# Determine set of SRR reads that align to Viral RefSeq

## Description

For an SRR I would like to know the set of reads that align to Viral RefSeq. Or more generally, which reads align to my set of reference
sequences.

## Notes

- Input: SRR accession number (or [ED]RR)

- Output: BAM file of the read alignments to reference sequences

There are a few ways of doing this, and it's not clear which is best. 

- which aligner to use?
	- need to ask the user
- use default options of the aligner?

## Estimate: 2
## Priority: Must
